# Download the zip file and extract files into a folder.

# Navigate to that folder using Terminal (Windows Shell or Command Prompt).

# Make sure you have Node.js environment installed in your local system.

# Run `npm install` or `npm install express` (This requires only express module).

# Run `npm start` command and the project should run on the localhost at given port (By default it's 3000).

# Open any browser and run `http:localhost:3000`.

# The Project is up and running. 

Note: This is just a sample assessment submission. Not any major project. Very basic UI and minimal stacks were used to focus more on the functionality.
